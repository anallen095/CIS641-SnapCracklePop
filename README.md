This project will focus on staffing and resource management for the ITC Deduction team at W.K. Kellogg Co. This team specializes in deduction management. Deductions are short payments on invoices from customers for any number of reasons - including trade promotions, fees, shortages, returns, etc. Analysts each handle a specific customer, but some customer account require more attention than others. This tool will track time and effort to clear the deduction balance and the skills for each analyst. It will allow the manager to assign workloads to different analysts in order to prioritize aging customer balances and reduce the risk of write-off.
